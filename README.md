# react-select-create-select-fixed

#Imports:

React, useEffect, and useState are imported from the 'react' library.
Types such as ActionMeta, OnChangeValue, and StylesConfig are imported from the 'react-select' library.
The CreatableSelect component is imported from 'react-select/creatable'.
Type Definitions:

KeywordType is an interface defining the shape of objects representing keywords. Each keyword has a value (e.g., "red"), a label (e.g., "Red"), and an isFixed property indicating whether the color is fixed.
Component Props:

The component takes in props through the ReaclCreateSelectFixedProps interface. It expects an array of KeywordType objects (keywords), a boolean flag (loading), and a function (setSearchArr) for setting the search array.
Styles Configuration:

The styles object defines the appearance of multi-value components in the dropdown based on whether the color is fixed. It adjusts background color, font weight, and display properties accordingly.
Utility Function:

orderOptions is a function that sorts an array of KeywordType objects. It groups fixed values first, followed by non-fixed values.
Component Implementation:

The ReaclCreateSelectFixed component is a functional React component.

It uses the useState hook to manage the state of the selected values (value) and available options (options).

The useEffect hook initializes the options and values when the keywords prop changes.

The component renders a CreatableSelect with various props:

isMulti: Allows multiple values to be selected.
onChange: Handles changes in selected values.
options: The available options for selection.
styles: Custom styling for the dropdown.
isClearable: Allows clearing of non-fixed values.
value: The selected values.
isLoading: Indicates whether the component is in a loading state.
Two useEffect hooks are used to update the options and trigger a search array update based on selected values.
